# Unit 2.3 Assignment: AreaFormulas

## Introduction

This assignment is supposed to give you some hands-on practice creating your methods in a class. Before starting this assignment you should be familiar with the following topics:
- How to create methods?
- Non-void methods
- Static vs non-static methods

One of my expectations is that you will look up information that you don't know yet. Some assignments include information that you haven't learned yet. This was done on purpose. Take the time to do your research on them and experiment with them.

**Be very cautious about using AI. It is a powerful tool, but it can lead to blindly copying and pasting directly into code. I ask that if you use AI, prompt it with questions, not commands.**

## Assignment Instructions

Open the AreaFormulas.java file and read through the comments. This is where all your code will go. DO NOT MODIFY AreaTester.java. In this assignment, you will have to write methods that will calculate the area of their shapes. The shapes you need to calculate area for are: Squares, Rectangles, Circles, Triangles, Trapezoids, and Ellipses. Recall what each method signature requires:
```java
scope returnType methodName(parameters) {
    // Code goes here
}
```


Let's take a look at the first comment:
```java
/*
 * Calculates the area of a square
 * @name SquareCalculation
 *
 * @param side - One of the side lengths of the square
 * 
 * @return the area of the square
 */
```
This comment should tell you everything you need to know. You know the name of the method, what the parameters should be, and what the method should return. You will need to create 6 methods for each of the shapes listed above. I suggest you write your methods right below the comments for better organization. The comments will guide you through the process. Some of the areas use PI in their equations, how can you get the most accurate representation of PI in Java?

## How to check your work?

To check to see if your code is correct, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
javac AreaFormulas.java
java AreaTester.java
```

If the output is: "All formulas look good!", then you have completed the assignment.

## Think you found a bug or a typo?

Please send me an email explaining where you believe you have found either a typo or a bug in the program. You can email me at daniel.tutors12@gmail.com. Try your best to explain the bug/typo to me and provide screenshots of the code/output if you can.
